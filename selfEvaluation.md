# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
  - This is my top priority to review first thing tomorrow morning! I'm not feeling very confident in the `for` statements, but am more confident in the if statements and can see that they work together.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
  - It was challenging and I very much felt like I was in an unproductive struggle, I feel like I've hit my max for today and was making a lot of syntax errors which was frusterating.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  - I probably need to review this entire lesson again. There are practices on the lesson that I plan to complete in the morning. I feel like trying to review this tonight wouldn't be productive as my energy is low.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
 - I'm not sure what questions to ask right now, the conditon is overall confusing for me. To get the answers that I need to my general confusion, plan to go over this lesson again, do the practices, and look in slack to read the expirences of others.
